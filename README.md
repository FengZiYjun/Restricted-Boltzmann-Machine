## How to use

`mnist_bin.npy` is an numpy binary file downloaded from [Mnist](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) or [github source](https://github.com/keezen/Fudan/tree/master/prml_2018/ass4_rbm), which contains 6 million images of hand written digits (0 - 9), with 28x28 as image shape.
Load this binary using numpy.
```python
import numpy as np
mnist = np.load('mnist_bin.npy')  # 60000x28x28
```

To use RBM from `rbm.py`, specify the number of hidden and visible units in initialization. 
```python
rbm = RBM(n_hidden=100, m_observe=28 * 28)
```

Train the RBM with `train` method, and feed it with data.
```python
rbm.train(mnist[:200], epochs=10)
```

After training, you can sample from RBM. What you get should be an image of a hand written digit generated by the model, which is not in the origin dataset.
Usually, a good initial image produces better results than random initialized inputs.
```python
v = rbm.sample(num_iter=200, v_init=mnist[0])
```

Visualize the output with matplotlib.
```python
plt.imshow(v.reshape((28, 28)), cmap="gray")
plt.show()
```

The full script:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

mnist = np.load('mnist_bin.npy')  # 60000x28x28
n_imgs, n_rows, n_cols = mnist.shape
img_size = n_rows * n_cols
print(mnist.shape)

# construct rbm model
rbm = RBM(n_hidden=100, m_observe=28 * 28)

print("Start RBM training.")
# train rbm model using mnist
rbm.train(mnist[:200], epochs=10)
print("Finish RBM training.")

# sample from rbm model
v = rbm.sample(num_iter=200, v_init=mnist[0])
plt.imshow(v.reshape((28, 28)), cmap="gray")
plt.show()
```
